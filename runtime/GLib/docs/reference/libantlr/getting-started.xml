  Hi and welcome to the version 4 release of ANTLR! It's named after the
  fearless hero of the Crazy Nasty-Ass Honey Badger since ANTLR v4 takes
  whatever you give it--it just doesn't give a crap! See Why do we need
  ANTLR v4? and the preface of the ANTLR v4 book.

GTK+ is a <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widget_toolkit">
  widget toolkit</ulink>. Each user interface created by
  GTK+ consists of widgets. This is implemented in C using
  <link linkend="GObject">GObject</link>, an object-oriented framework for C.
  Widgets are organized in a hierachy. The window widget is the main container.
  The user interface is then built by adding buttons, drop-down menus, input
  fields, and other widgets to the window.
  If you are creating complex user interfaces it is recommended to
  use #GtkBuilder and its GTK-specific markup description language, instead of
  assembling the interface manually. You can also use a visual user interface
  editor, like <ulink url="https://glade.gnome.org/">Glade</ulink>.</para>
